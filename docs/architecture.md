# Architecture

TAREL is a local-first context compiler, not an agent framework. Its reusable core maps technical
metadata, semantic claims, relationships, and lineage into deterministic contracts. The CLI, SDK,
and browser UI are three adapters over the same application behavior.

```text
CLI · Python SDK · local browser UI
                 │
                 ▼
       application use cases
                 │
                 ▼
 graph · annotation · semantic import · lineage · discovery · workspace · retrieval
                 │
                 ▼
 connectors · providers · file stores · optional indexes
```

Dependencies point inward. Domain code does not import the CLI, SDK, or UI. Entry adapters may
compose application use cases, but they do not own a second implementation of the business rules.

## Layers

| Layer | Main paths | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Entry adapters | `tarel.cli`, `tarel.sdk`, `tarel.ui` | Parse input, call use cases, render typed results |
| Application | `tarel.application`, `tarel.grounding_application`, domain `application.py` modules | Coordinate stores, domain transformations, and explicit side effects |
| Domain | `graph`, `annotations`, `semantics`, `lineage`, `discovery`, `focus`, `relationships`, `workspaces`, `context`, `grounding` | Contracts, validation, revisions, review state, traversal, and deterministic compilation |
| Infrastructure | `connectors`, `providers`, `retrieval`, domain stores | Observe external systems and persist local rebuildable state |
| Runtime | `tarel.runtime` | Bind one SDK client to an explicit local state root |

## One implementation, three entry points

The CLI and SDK call the same application functions. A graph built with the CLI can be loaded by
the SDK; a review performed in the browser changes the same revisioned document. The browser UI is
served from the standard library and consumes the same graph, workspace, focus, annotation, and
lineage projections.

```text
tarel source build ... ─┐
Tarel(...).source... ───┼─► application use case ─► domain contract ─► .tarel state
local review UI ────────┘
```

`import tarel` stays cheap and side-effect free. Source drivers and the local embedding runtime are
optional and imported only inside their adapters.

## Semantic graph path

```text
read-only source
  → connector observations
  → technical graph
  → model or coding-agent proposals
  → human review
  → BM25 / optional local embeddings
  → bounded context packet
```

Technical observations and semantic claims remain separate. An annotation begins as a draft and
keeps its evidence, provider identity, confidence, and review state. The source remains
authoritative; TAREL stores metadata and reviewable knowledge rather than a warehouse copy.

External semantic models form a third, explicit layer. A `tarel.semantic_import.v0.1` document
keeps the exact source snapshot, normalized semantic objects, diagnostics, and deterministic
bindings to graph node or edge IDs. Imported values are not promoted to TAREL annotations. Source
corrections are overlays that preserve the original snapshot. This experimental boundary is
documented in [Semantic-model imports](semantic-imports.md).

Source enrichment is a separate, policy-gated observation path. Each logical source explicitly
grants `aggregates`, `small_domains`, `raw_samples`, and/or `entity_aliases`; an omitted grant
denies that operation. `entity_aliases` requires `aggregates` and is limited to protected
same-object inspection and key groups produced by optional Self-Entity discovery. It does not
expand the bounded `raw_samples` permission.
The batch compiler profiles every object in a bound graph and returns an ephemeral workfile. Raw
samples remain process output. Repeated composite-key patterns may produce aggregate-only draft
join candidates, but writing those candidates is explicit and never makes them reviewed truth.
Pattern inference is intentionally conservative: it considers textual key-like fields or clear
multi-prefix composite keys, rejects temporal and ordinary free-text shapes, requires the literal
segment cue to match the target object or field, and keeps at most one target per source segment.
It is therefore normal for enrichment to report useful patterns while persisting no join drafts.

## Lineage path

```text
report / visual / measure
  → semantic field
  → physical mart object
  → query, model, procedure, or job
  → upstream tables
  → source-system origins
```

Workflow importers normalize external exports into one lineage contract. Optional providers may
analyze complete SQL definitions and propose evidence-backed reads and writes. Job order, procedure
calls, and physical data flow remain distinct; TAREL never treats execution order alone as data
lineage. Cross-document traversal is explicit and preserves unresolved references, review state,
evidence, cycles, and granularity changes.

## Grounding and cache boundaries

Search chooses graph anchors; the context compiler expands them through reviewed relationships and
reports every omission caused by a budget. `tarel.grounding.v0.1` then adds non-secret source
identity, SQL dialect, selected lineage revisions, matches, and an optional upstream trace.

Agent-facing output has two independently hashed parts:

- `stable`: selected semantic facts, joins, source identities, and lineage document revisions;
- `dynamic`: the question, retrieval decisions, paths, warnings, omissions, and optional trace.

This lets a harness place reusable context in a provider cache-friendly prefix without making the
core provider-specific.

## Extension boundaries

TAREL deliberately has a few narrow extension seams:

- **Connectors** normalize read-only probes, catalog discovery, bounded sampling, and relationship
  evidence. Reviewed external packages register through the `tarel.connectors` entry-point group.
- **Providers** return schema-validated annotation or lineage workfiles. Provider profiles and
  metadata-only discovery hypotheses. Provider profiles and credentials stay outside persisted
  graphs, discovery runs, and context packets. Providers cannot record discovery evidence or make
  discovery decisions.
- **Semantic readers** preserve an external semantic model, normalize supported constructs, and
  bind only exact matches to a TAREL graph. Apache Ossie, SML, and Cube YAML exercise one internal
  contract. A public plugin ABI waits until that contract has survived broader format coverage and
  review.
- **Stores** are file-first today. Shared database-backed stores and authorization can be added as
  optional adapters without changing domain contracts.

Generated connector or provider candidates are inactive until a human reviews and installs them.
Self-extension removes repetitive adapter work; it does not grant generated code automatic trust.

## Persistence boundary

The selected state root contains revisioned JSON documents and rebuildable indexes:

```text
.tarel/
├── sources/
├── graphs/
├── discovery/
├── semantic-imports/
├── lineage/
├── focus/
├── workspaces/
├── indexes/
└── lineage-analysis-cache/
```

Writes are atomic. Documents use canonical ordering and SHA-256 identities and omit timestamps,
runtime durations, and volatile paths from agent-facing contracts. The first SDK supports
concurrent reads and one writer per document; coordinated multi-writer storage is intentionally an
optional future adapter.

Enrichment workfiles are intentionally absent from this tree. A caller may redirect one to a
private location, but TAREL does not place raw samples in graphs, indexes, or context packets.

Experimental discovery documents retain typed candidate programs, their AVO-style parent and
generation lineage, aggregate observations, decisions, and step ordering. They omit query/code
text, raw rows, samples, credentials, connection details, volatile source paths, and free-form
database errors. Discovery is opt-in and does not alter graph or context behavior unless a caller
explicitly promotes a selected candidate. Exact joins enter relationship review as drafts. Entity
programs enter the separate entity-resolution store as unreviewed candidates with versioned
execution identity and TAREL-computed quality. Explicit Self-Entity programs additionally bind one
object, a separate technical record key, comparison/guard fields, and canonical unordered-pair
semantics; external callers still own matching and grouping. Equivalent unreviewed Self-Entity
evidence advances through an explicit immutable supersede chain. Both bridges leave validation
human-controlled.

## Public surface

The stable entry points are the `tarel` command and `from tarel.sdk import Tarel`. Domain modules
remain available for typed integration, but consumers should prefer the SDK unless they are
implementing or testing a TAREL extension.

The architectural rule is simple:

```text
contracts define truth; use cases coordinate work; adapters remain replaceable
```
